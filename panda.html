      The giant panda, native to the mountain ranges of central China, is a bear species easily recognized 
      by its distinctive black and white coat. Although classified as a carnivore, pandas primarily eat bamboo, 
      which makes up more than 99% of their diet. They are a global symbol of wildlife conservation and are 
      known for their gentle, solitary behavior and playful nature.
