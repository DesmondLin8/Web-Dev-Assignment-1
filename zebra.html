      The zebra is a herbivorous equid best known for its striking black-and-white striped coat, which serves as camouflage and a deterrent to predators.
      Native to the grasslands, savannas, and woodlands of Africa, zebras live in herds and are highly social animals.
      They are strong runners and rely on speed, agility, and group defense to survive in the wild.
