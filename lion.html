      The lion is a large, muscular carnivorous feline native to grasslands and savannas across sub-Saharan Africa, with a small population also found in western India.
      It is the second-largest living cat species after the tiger and is unique for its social behavior, living in groups called prides.
      Lions are powerful apex predators, known for their distinctive manes and resonant roars that can carry over long distances.
